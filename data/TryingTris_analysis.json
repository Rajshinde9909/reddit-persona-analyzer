As soon as it was fired, starting from the very first mag it just doesn't anymore. I'm not sure if it's residue or heat causing it but it happens with all 3 mags. The good news is that it cycled all of my 115 gr S&B ammo without issues whatsoever.\n\nAnyone else have a similar experience? \n\nI've heard that the Global Ordinance mags are good but there aren't a lot of feedback on those yet.",

My recent order had a lot of produce in it and every single item was in a different HEB plastic bag. 1 bag for an onion, 1 bag for 2 poblanos, 1 bag for cilantro, 1 bag for 2 serranos, 1 bag for 6 tomatillos, etc... I counted 24 plastic bags for an order that could probably fit easily in 6 or 7 plastic bags. \n\nIt's not location dependent, I feel like every location I've been to does this (Bunker Hill, Buffalo/Washington, & W. Alabama). Is it simply cost vs convenience/efficiency? ",

        "text": "Hi Everyone, I've tried to search this subreddit for a scenario similar to mine and found some information but I'm not sure how definitive it is quite yet.\n\nI work in TX, and as of Jan 4th 2025, moved to VA to live with my mother for health reasons.\n\nMy living and work situation for 2025 will basically be:\n\n* Spending 2 weeks in VA\n* Commuting back to TX (2-3 days)\n* 3 weeks work tour in TX\n* Commuting back to VA (2-3 days)\n\nI work a rotational shift work job so I will effectively only be in VA for \\~18 weeks/126 days in 2025. During the rest of the time that I'm in TX I will be living in a corporate housing situation, and will effectively not have a permanent residency address in TX. However I do have family in TX and could opt to move in with them on my work visits instead, if that has a tax implication one way or another. I plan on keeping my TX drivers license, and I have a car and motorcycle which are titled and registered in TX and should remain as such.\n\nThe move is most likely temporary with the hopes that my mother's health will improve in the next 1 - 2 years with consistent follow up on doctor's visit and medication regimen.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Do I still need to file a VA tax return if I spend less than 183 days in VA?\n2. Do I file a non-resident tax return and claim exemption since I'm there less than 183 days in the year?\n3. Would anything change if I update my home address to VA with my employer? I assume my tax withholding will increase to account for potential state income tax but should be refunded once I file taxes?\n4. Same question for my credit cards bills/mailing address. If I update it to VA does it have any tax implications down the road?\n5. While I won't have a lease/rental agreement, I will be helping my sister (who owns the house) pay part of the mortgage (basically sending her money over zelle). Does this have any impact on my end?\n6. Is it a dick move to not want to pay the full amount of state income tax in VA if I'm only there for \\~1/3 of the year?\n\nI've been mostly fretting over what I'm going to do with my current bills/home address in the fear that changing them could somehow shove me into a disadvantageous tax position.\n\nThank you in advance for any input!\n\n  \nEdit:\n\nFollow-up. I consulted a tax lawyer and was told that basically since I will be spending less than 183 days in VA I will not be considered a resident for tax purposes and will not need to file a VA tax return. Simple as that. He also recommended keeping a low profile and just keeping my mailing addresses in TX to avoid any complications.",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I'm a complete beginner when it comes to the projector world and I'd love some advice to nail down the right setup for me within budget. Per the Wiki here's my info\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Maximum budget - $2000 (prefer to keep it to $1500 if possible but if the $500 bump results in significant quality upgrade then I'm in, can stretch to $2500 if needed though that will delay the project since I'll need to save more money).\n2. Screen size - 135\" (I have pretty tall ceilings, \\~150\" or so and could probably go bigger if it optimizes the setup)\n3. Distance from back wall or preferred mounting position to screen wall - \\~160\" will be mounted on a shelf on the back wall\n4. Seating distance to screen - 140\"-150\"\n5. How will you mount? - Rear Shelf/Cabinet.\n6. Usage - 50% movies / 50% gaming.\n7. Room type - Living room.\n8. Ambient  light, through lighting or light leakage from windows? - Minimal ambient light. 1 window in living room that can have blackout curtains installed and would essentially give me pitch black condition.\n9. Room colors - Walls (beige), Ceiling (beige), and floors (wood floors, med dark brown).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome other info, this will be my primary and likely only screen setup at home so I would like the flexibility of using it with some lights on in my living room if possible. I would like to avoid the added cost of an acoustic perf screen as I'll probably keep it simple with a soundbar below the screen.\n\nI like the BenQ TK700STi but if I'm using the throw calculator correctly it puts out a massive +170\" diagonal screen at \\~160\", I'm not against it but I need to double check to see if I can pull it off (both on physical size and on additional cost). I like the Android TV feature on it and would likely utilize that a ton. \n\n\\[edit\\] - I just realized that the \"ST\" stands for short throw and I could probably just go with the TK700 and benefit from all the same features of the TK700STi minus the android dongle. \\[/edit\\]\n\nI've seen Silver Ticket screens mentioned for pretty good budget screens on a fixed frame and would probably go that way unless a better option is available?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for the input!",

        "text": "Wondering if anybody that has an Anvil Foundry may have ran into this issue? I've tried searching reddit/google and came up empty.\n\nI bought one of the new runs of the Anvil Foundry 10.5 gallon system. It was delivered on Thursday. I set it up yesterday and connected it to my kitchen GFCI outlet for a test run to see how long it would take to heat up strike water, how well it would hold temp if I just cut the power and let it sit for an hour, etc...\n\nHere's what I did:\n\n1. Filled the vessel with 7.5 gallons of water (most of the parts came pre-installed, I just had to screw on the spigot valve handle).\n2. Connected to a GFCI outlet and powered the system on. The temp controller powers on with no issues, all buttons function as expected.\n3. Left the temperature setting as F, and set it to 152 degF.\n4. Set the power at 100%, heard the fan kick on which I thought may have indicated the heating element is on.\n5. Waited.\n\nNothing happened. Water did not heat up in the slightest. The water was at 77 degF to start, and did not gain a single degF in an hour. I don't think it's a breaker issue because the whole temp control unit is powering on. Unless they have separate breakers for the temperature controller and the heating element? If that's the case I don't know where the location of the other breaker is.\n\nI already emailed Anvil support last night and I'm waiting for a response. Tried calling them today but I lost track of time and called outside their support hours. I'm sure they'll get back in touch eventually but I don't know if it'll be before the weekend and I'm really just curious if this could have been operator error or perhaps a simple fix?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Got in touch with Doug from the Blichmann group and he pulled a Foundry 10.5 gal unit, tested it to make sure it heats up just fine, and packed it up for shipment later today. I'll just need to send mine back. Didn't get any troubleshooting tips but I do plan on keeping in touch to see if there was anything I could have done to rectify the situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: The new shipped unit works fine, I had a brew day with it and for the most part it's what I expected. Heating times are surprisingly quick, faster than my Unibrau V2 setup. Boil is way more vigorous as well.",

I'm less comfortable with a super thin backpack setup as my EDC bag in areas with higher theft risk.\n\nI plan on taking my current EDC bag which is a Timbuktu Flight Messenger bag (size small).

        "text": "So I'm brewing a 3 gallon batch of DIPA style beer with planned OG being 1.073 SG. Mfg recommendation (Omega yeast) is direct pitch for any 5 gallon wort up to 1.060 SG, and to create a starter for anything higher.  \n\nSince I'm running a much lower batch volume will I still need to create a starter? 3 gallons of 1.073 is equivalent to 5 gallons of 1.044 is part of the logic behind my initial thinking.   \n\nBut then I read more about osmotic pressure due to increased sugar content and I guess if that's the main reason to pitch higher then the smaller volume would still need a starter since it's above 1.060? \n\nI'm using Omega Saisonsteins Monster and at the same time if I underpitch it might not be the end of the world if it means just a bit more belgiany ester production?  \n\nThoughts on this?

        "text": "So I kegged my pale ale for the first time (\\~4.5% ABV - Marris Otter w/ Cascade/Centennial/Galaxy) last Friday and followed this process:\n\n\\- Sanitized corney keg/transfer equipment, etc...\n\n\\- Lubed O-rings, dropped in hop basket with 2 oz keg hops, purged O2, connected gas to the liquid line and opened the keg. Fill with a bit more CO2 via the liquid line and start transferring beer into the keg.\n\n\\- Sealed up keg (used pressure to close the keg opening and then latched). Tested for leaks, everything was all clear.\n\n\\- Placed in fridge and set to 30 psi for burst carb. Read a bit more about burst carb on Brulosophy and decided to set it to 40 psi and leave it overnight.\n\n\\- Ended up leaving the keg at 40 psi the fridge for \\~14 hours. So total time so far has been 2 hours on 30 psi + 14 hours on 40 psi. Reduced to serving pressure of 12 psi. Tested it just to see what amount of carbonation was there. It was basically flat, poured with zero head and had a barely perceptible hint of carbonation on the tip of your tongue.\n\n\\- I've been taking tiny samples each day (after clearing the line) just to see how much it progresses, and it still pours with zero head but has a bit more perceptible carbonation on the tongue. Still considerably flat though.\n\nMy questions:\n\n\\- On the flavor of the beer. The aroma is amazing but the flavor has a slight vegetal flavor to it. The hops have not sat for very long but I'm wondering if the hop sedimentation is interfering with the flavor. I've noticed that as it sits the vegetal flavor has reduced which I'm attributing to the fact that the hops (whatever particles got out of the mesh basket) has settled out a bit. Or maybe yeast in suspension? I used Wyeast 1968 which flocculated like crazy. The finished beer looked pretty damn clear in the fermenter, but it's pouring pretty hazy right now. Chill haze? Hop particles? I did not use oats in the mash, was actually shooting for a clearer beer.\n\n\\- On the carbonation. Did I make a mistake in \"calculation\" for the carbonation times? Should I have waited until my beer and keg was ice cold prior to starting the actual burst carbonation?\n\nI have no doubt that time will solve all of these issues (well not sure about the vegetal flavor but it is definitely diminishing with time for now), but I'm just curious so I know what to do differently next time. Oh also, I went ahead and leaned the keg to the gas side to get the hop canister as far from the liquid dip tube as possible. I wonder if that has anything to do with the flavor change.\n\nSo many questions.\n\nThanks!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: As expected... just needed time for the carbonation. As for the flavor, it's improved significantly with the funky vegetal flavor dissipating over time. However it's still lingering a tad. I'm starting to wonder if it's a keg hop issue (used Centennial and Galaxy, and maybe Centennial's spice characteristic I'm just not a fan of?). Still not sure, but it's getting better every day.

        "title": "Recipe Critique: Dry Hopped Saison",
        "text": "Hi guys, \n\nFinally got to try out the saison we brewed a little over a month ago. My goal was to have a relatively light saison with some nice dry hop aroma that's easy to drink for the summer months. Opted for French Saison yeast as I'm not the biggest fan of too much belgian character in lighter beers.\n\nHere's the recipe I used. I sort of combined a couple of different recipes I saw online and swapped out hops on the fly with whatever was available at the LHBS (not all willy nilly, I tried to match the IBU totals and pick up hops that should lend good flavor to the beer). I've annotated the recipe with our Actual OG/FG numbers. Did all of the fermentation in one vessel and dry hopped 7 days in. Total time in vessel was 2 weeks.\n\nNotes on the beer: \n\n* Beers are bottled into bombers, and sample is poured into a 10 oz tulip. Color is a medium golden hue, bubbly head formation with the pour which dissipates relatively quickly.\n* Dry hop aroma is good, nelson sauvin comes in with a dry almost effervescent aroma and the motueka gives it a very pleasant fruit forward aroma.\n* On yeast choice, I like this one quite a bit. Very light hint of clove with a slightly more prominent bubblegum flavor. It seems more fruit forward as well but I'm not sure how much of that is imparted from the hop selection.\n* It is VERY dry, unexpectedly so. Our OG was low to begin with and at the end of two weeks we were at 1.000 FG. I honestly didn't know that you could ferment that far, is this a recipe flaw or technique issue? I'm not opposed to super dry beers (and it seems the saison is one of the dryest beer styles), but I was shooting for the upper range of the style guideline to balance out the hops a bit more. It seems with how dry it is the bittering hops take over a bit more.\n\nIdeally I'd like to repeat the recipe and come up with something even more fruit forward and maybe take away that dryness just a touch.

        "text": "Original post is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/8mr9w8/unibrau\\_v3\\_brewing\\_getting\\_low\\_og/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/8mr9w8/unibrau_v3_brewing_getting_low_og/)\n\nAlright this will be a longer post than the previous one. I'll take you guys through the brewing steps in a bit more detail and please let me know if this is something I fucked up.\n\nA bit of background, my friend and I have brewed about 14 batches of beer. Starting with a regular BIAB setup, then upgraded to a three vessel setup, and now we further \"upgraded\" to an electric BIAB type setup. With our three vessel setup we were able to hit OG/FG fairly easily after the first couple brew days. With our new Unibrau V3 setup it seems that none of our beers are even close to the recipe's OG.\n\nOn to the most recent brew day, brewing a double IPA, a modified Pliney Clone.\n\nRecipe was built using Brewers Friend web app.\n\nGrain bill:\n\n14 lb Two Row\n\n0.75 lb Crystal 60L\n\n11.5 oz Dextrose \\(late addition/flameout\\)\n\nDesigned for a 5.5 gal yield, into the fermentor \\(1.18 gal grain absorption, 1.5 gal boil off, 0.06 gal kettle loss, 0.25 gal hop absorption\\)\n\nWater needed in theory: \\~8.4 gal initial water input needed initially, \\~7.2 gal wort collected pre\\-boil,\n\nExpected pre\\-boil gravity is 1.053, expected OG is 1.075, and expected FG is 1.014\n\nBrew steps:\n\n\\- First hiccup already, our brew vessel won't fit 8.4 gal of water \\+ 14.75 lb of grain. So I used 7 gal of strike water instead, heated to 161F to bring mash temp to 152F. In theory \\(if I used the calculator correctly\\) this should give me 5.8 gal of wort with a 1.066 pre boil gravity \\(assuming 70&#37; eff\\), which I can then dilute with 1.4 gal of water to bring back to 1.053.\n\n\\- Went through the mash without much issue. At first it seemed a bit stuck but I adjusted the RIMS flow rate, and stirred the grain bed a few times and the flow ended up being pretty good. Picked up the basket and could hear it trickle down at a \"good rate\".\n\n\\- At the end of the mash I took a sample of the wort and stuck it in a metal bowl in the freezer to cool ASAP. It measured as 1.060 pre boil gravity, with 5.8 gal of wort vol. Which calculates to to 64&#37; mash efficiency, not too terrible at this point.\n\n\\- Instead of diluting with the planned 1.4 and sacrificing the OG, I adjusted and added 0.8 gal of water to bring it to the original planned 1.053.\n\n\\- Proceeded with 90 min boil and hop additions, added dextrose at flameout along with whirlpool hops. Cooled down through a plate chiller and measured FG \\(\\~5.2 gal in the kettle post boil\\) is 1.062 :\\(. It's quite a ways off of the 1.075 the recipe calculated \\(70&#37; efficiency\\). 1.062 is with the dextrose added in... which is crazy to me.\n\nSide notes:\n\n\\- I was extra anal on volume management this time and everything was pretty much spot on and matched my equipment setup in the recipe builder. I also confirmed that the volume reading on the kettle is accurate.\n\n\\- Double checked temp coming out of RIMS system and it's spot on \\(\\+/\\- 0.5F\\)\n\n\\- Spoke to the homebrew store \\(ordered online this time\\) and requested the grains milled twice for a finer crush and to me it looked a bit finer but I can't be certain. Next brew I'll grab grains myself and make sure the grains are milled twice.\n\n\\- Skipped using rice hulls this time around, mainly because I was already running a 14.75 lb grain bill. Didn't seem to have any issues with a stuck mash.\n\nAll in all, I'm not that surprised at the 65&#37; mash efficiency for now. Could just be the grain crush again. I am pretty surprised at the low FG especially considering the dextrose addition \\(should be \\+ 0.06 from the dextrose I think\\). Anyway, the beer smells amazing either way and I'm pretty sure will come out fantastic. Just annoyed at the little inaccuracies in the process \\(either my recipe building skills is completely crap or process management on brew day is pretty off\\).\n\nIf anybody has a recipe for their Unibrau V3 \\(with exact water measurements\\) that has worked well in the past please let me know. I'd love to give it a run and see if we can match the numbers.\n\nTL;DR Brewed again and still had a pretty low OG although it wasn't too terrible. Better than the last one at least.\n\nEdit:\n\nSo I completely forgot this. When I took the pre\\-boil gravity reading I didn't have a vessel tall enough for the hydrometer. So I used the hydrometer storage tube instead. It read 1.056 which seemed really low, so I used water and sure enough got 0.996. I made a stupid assumption and applied a \\+0.004 correction factor to the pre\\-boil OG! In hindsight the 1.056 is probably closer to correct and the water reading was erroneous because the tube was a little too tight. I don't think there was enough space between the wall of the storage tube and the hydrometer itself to allow for free movement. Stupid mistake.\n\nAnyway, I recalculated the numbers using 1.056 pre\\-boil gravity and it's making a bit more sense. What still doesn't make sense is the fact that the dextrose didn't contribute to the post boil gravity reading at all \\(which is insane\\). \n\nIs it possible that the dextrose just didn't stir in enough? I admit I didn't stir it vigorously because the whole system was cycling through the pump and plate chiller and I made the assumption that the dextrose would get mixed in that way anyway? Fuckin a. I need to get a proper checklist going on for the next brew. Stirring will be on the checklist lol.",

        "text": "Hi guys, I've lurked around this subreddit a bit but this is my first time posting here.\n\nMy friend and I recently purchased a Unibrau V3 and we've brewed two batches in it so far. The first batch went decent, with OG being slightly lower than expected. The second batch seemed to go smoothly but again OG was way low \\(1.040 rather than 1.056\\).\n\nI double checked my calculations on Brewer's Friend, and also double checked on the \"Wort\" app for Android and it came out with similar numbers.\n\nWe used 11.5 lb of 2 Row, mashed at 150, had 7.5 gal of wort, and about 5.5 gal fermentor volume. Expected pre boil OG with 70&#37; eff is 1.040, and expected post is 1.054. Actual pre boil OG was 1.031 and post was 1.040. SUPER LOW... \n\nOh and we opted for a super thin mash instead of sparging \\(close to 3 qt/lb ratio\\). I know there's arguments about it affecting pH, etc... but it should not affect sugar conversion that adversely \\(plus we used pH5.2\\). \n\nAnybody else having this issue with the Unibrau? I have difficulty believing that the efficiency of this setup is drastically lower than our previous setup \\(standard 3 container all grain setup\\).\n\nAt the moment the main troubleshooting steps I can think of are:\n\n\\- Double check the volume marker on the main kettle \\(maybe marker is showing less than actual?\\)\n\n\\- Double check temp coming out of the RIMS system \\(maybe mash temp was too low?\\)\n\nJust wanted to see if any other Unibrau brewers ran into a similar issue.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Hi everybody,\n\nI bought a used 2016 WRX STi which for the most part seems to be in perfect mechanical condition. The mechanics isn't what I'm quite worried about.\n\nHere's the thing, when I drive it I get this issue where it gets a bit harder to breathe. I don't get light headed or have a headache, just the odd breathing issue. Like it's harder for me to take in a full breath. A bit more about the car. I bought the car from a dealership. When I bought it, I knew the previous owner was a smoker because I could smell a very faint odor in the car. However for the most part the car smells like \"new car\" smell... that smell you get in every used car that's been detailed and what not. I didn't notice the issue during the test drive since those last around 10 - 15 minutes usually. And really, when you get in the car you can't smell any kind of \"chemical odor\" whatsoever... just the fragrance smell.\n  \n\nI can only assume that whatever cleaning product the previous owner (or the dealership) used to mask the smoke smell may be overly strong? \n  \n\nFor a while I thought I was just going a bit crazy, but I drove a rental car for the weekend while the car was getting the CPO inspection performed and I felt completely fine in the rental.\n  \n\nOne last tidbit of information... I recently noticed that when I get out of the car and breathe/exhale internally I can smell a very faint ammonia smell. By breathe internally I mean that thing where you pump air from your mouth into your nose... kind of like when you're trying to pick up flavors from wine or food or something.\n  \n\nI'm pretty sure the below things aren't the issue:  \n* I'm not sensitive to smoke smell or cigarette residue as I grew up with smoking parents so I'm pretty sure it's not that.   \n* I don't think it's an issue with a leaky exhaust as I haven't detected any leaks (via sight, sound, and running my hand around the downpipe/midpipe/axleback connection points). And the exhaust is stock, with a catalytic converter n all that.  \n* Read a thread about a mouse/rat's nest in the airbox causing ammonia smell... Longshot but I checked it anyway and that wasn't it.  \n* I already changed the cabin air filter behind the glove box.\n  \n\nI'm at the verge of getting a full professional detail done with steaming out the carpet/headliner and cleaning out the HVAC system... Just wondering if any of you guys might have another clue as to what could be the culprit.",

They submitted the claim to my insurance company and the insurance company has come back and denied the claim. They're saying that because I broke my teeth in an accidental injury it should be covered by my medical insurance.\n\nMeanwhile my medical insurance is high deductible so it would pretty much be 100% out of pocket if I did pursue that route.\n\nDoes anybody know if I have any recourse with the dental insurance? \n\nI don't think it makes a difference, but my medical and dental is covered by the same company.",

Well shit... could be he's shitty at wheelies. Could be he installed the frame slider incorrectly. Could be a combination of both. \n\nI have 30k+ on my MT09 (3rd gen), ride through gravel tracks on my tours quite regularly, and in general don't treat my bike gently (though admittedly I don't pull crazy wheelies). No issues here. Additionally if this was such a huge and prevalent issue (like the TPS sensor issue) then there would be at the very least weekly to monthly posts on the [fz09.org](http://fz09.org) forum about it, yet there is not. \n\nSo yeah I'm skeptical.",
